It is just a small console application.

I used it to practice coding, and to learn few concepts (applied in a console app) like these :

- The DI container, 
- The application Host, 
- The IServiceCollection and IServiceProvider, 
- The service scopes, 
- How to use SQLite with EF Core so that it automatically creates a DB at startup if no DB already exists,
- How to configure the application host based on a json file that I created,
- How to deserialize a json file in order to load data into my application.
